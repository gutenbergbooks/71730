<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> a Provence rose.</p>

<p>A little slender rose, with leaves of shining
green and blossoms of purest white,—a little
fragile thing, but fair, they said, growing in the
casement in a chamber in a street.</p>

<p>I remember my birth-country well. A great
wild garden, where roses grew together by millions
and tens of millions, all tossing our bright
heads in the light of a southern sun on the
edge of an old, old city—old as Rome—whose
ruins were clothed with the wild fig-tree
and the scarlet blossom of the climbing creepers
growing tall and free in our glad air of
France.</p>

<p>I remember how the ruined aqueduct went
like a dark shadow straight across the plains;
how the green and golden lizards crept in and
out and about amongst the grasses; how the
cicala sang her song in the moist, sultry eves;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
how the women from the wells came trooping
by, stately as monarchs, with their water-jars
upon their heads; how the hot hush of the
burning noons would fall, and all things droop
and sleep except ourselves; how swift amongst
us would dart the little blue-winged birds, and
hide their heads in our white breasts and drink
from our hearts the dew, and then hover above
us in their gratitude, with sweet, faint music of
their wings, till sunset came.</p>

<p>I remember— But what is the use? I am
only a rose; a thing born for a day, to bloom
and be gathered, and die. So you say: you
must know. God gave you all created things
for your pleasure and use. So you say.</p>

<p>There my birth was; there I lived—in the
wide south, with its strong, quivering light, its
radiant skies, its purple plains, its fruits of
gourd and vine. I was young; I was happy;
I lived: it was enough.</p>

<p>One day a rough hand tore me from my
parent stem and took me, bleeding and drooping,
from my birthplace, with a thousand other
captives of my kind. They bound a score of
us up together, and made us a cruel substitute
for our cool, glad garden-home with poor
leaves, all wet from their own tears, and mosses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
torn as we were from their birth-nests under
the great cedars that rose against the radiant
native skies.</p>

<p>Then we were shut in darkness for I know
not how long a space; and when we saw the
light of day again we were lying with our dear
dead friends, the leaves, with many flowers of
various kinds, and foliage and ferns and shrubs
and creeping plants, in a place quite strange
to us,—a place filled with other roses and with
all things that bloom and bear in the rich days
of midsummer,—a place which I heard them
call the market of the Madeleine. And when
I heard that name I knew that I was in Paris.</p>

<p>For many a time, when the dread hand of
the reaper had descended upon us, and we had
beheld our fairest and most fragrant relatives
borne away from us to death, a shiver that was
not of the wind had run through all our boughs
and blossoms, and all the roses had murmured
in sadness and in terror, “Better the worm or
the drought, the blight or the fly, the whirlwind
that scatters us as chaff, or the waterspout
that levels our proudest with the earth—better
any of these than the long-lingering death by
famine and faintness and thirst that awaits
every flower which goes to the Madeleine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>It was an honor, no doubt, to be so chosen.
A rose was the purest, the sweetest, the haughtiest
of all her sisterhood ere she went thither.
But, though honor is well no doubt, yet it
surely is better to blow free in the breeze and
to live one’s life out, and to be, if forgotten by
glory, yet also forgotten by pain. Nay, yet:
I have known a rose, even a rose who had but
one little short life of a summer day to live
through and to lose, perish glad and triumphant
in its prime because it died on a woman’s
breast and of a woman’s kiss. You see there
are roses as weak as men are.</p>

<p>I awoke, I say, from my misery and my long
night of travel, with my kindred beside me in
exile, on a flower-stall of the Madeleine.</p>

<p>It was noon—the pretty place was full of
people: it was June, and the day was brilliant.
A woman of Picardy sat with us on the board
before her,—a woman with blue eyes and ear-rings
of silver, who bound us together in fifties
and hundreds into those sad gatherings of our
pale ghosts which in your human language you
have called “bouquets.” The loveliest and
greatest amongst us suffered decapitation, as
your Marie Stuarts and Marie Antoinettes did,
and died at once to have their beautiful, bright<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
heads impaled—a thing of death, a mere
mockery of a flower—on slender spears of
wire. I, a little white and fragile thing, and
very young, was in no way eminent enough
amongst my kind to find that martyrdom which
as surely awaits the loveliest of our roses as it
awaits the highest fame of your humanity.</p>

<p>I was bound up amongst a score of others
with ropes of gardener’s bass to chain me
amidst my fellow-prisoners, and handed over
by my jailer with the silver ear-rings to a youth
who paid for us with a piece of gold—whether
of great or little value I know not now. None
of my own roses were with me: all were strangers.
You never think, of course, that a little
rose can care for its birthplace or its kindred;
but you err.</p>

<p>O fool! Shall we not care for one another?—we
who have so divine a life in common,
who together sleep beneath the stars, and together
sport in the summer wind, and together
listen to the daybreak singing of the birds,
whilst the world is dark and deaf in slumber—we
who know that we are all of heaven that God,
when He called away His angels, bade them
leave on the sin-stained, weary, sickly earth to
now and then make man remember Him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>You err. We love one another well; and if
we may not live in union, we crave at least
in union to droop and die. It is seldom that
we have this boon. Wild flowers can live and
die together; so can the poor amongst you:
but we of the cultivated garden needs must
part and die alone.</p>

<p>All the captives with me were strangers:
haughty, scentless pelargoniums; gardenias,
arrogant even in their woe; a knot of little,
humble forget-me-nots, ashamed in the grand
company of patrician prisoners; a stephanalis,
virginal and pure, whose dying breath was
peace and sweetness; and many sprays of myrtle
born in Rome, whose classic leaves wailed
Tasso’s lamentation as they went.</p>

<p>I must have been more loosely fettered than
the rest were, for in the rough, swift motion of
the youth who bore us my bonds gave way and
I fell through the silver transparency of our
prison-house, and dropped stunned upon the
stone pavement of a street.</p>

<p>There I lay long, half senseless, praying, so
far as I had consciousness, that some pitying
wind would rise and waft me on his wings away
to some shadow, some rest, some fresh, cool
place of silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>I was tortured with thirst; I was choked with
dust; I was parched with heat.</p>

<figure class="figright illowe15_625" id="i_p07">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p07.jpg" alt="A Young Girl had Found and Rescued Me">
</figure>

<p>The sky was as brass, the stones as red-hot
metal; the sun scorched
like flame on the glare of
the staring walls; the
heavy feet of the hurrying
crowd tramped past me
black and ponderous;
with every step I thought
my death would come
under the crushing weight
of those clanging heels.</p>

<p>It was five seconds,
five hours—which I know
not. The torture was too
horrible to be measured
by time. I must have
been already dead, or at
the very gasp of death,
when a cool, soft touch
was laid on me; I was
gently lifted, raised to
tender lips, and fanned
with a gentle, cooling breath,—breath from the
lips that had kissed me.</p>

<p>A young girl had found and rescued me,—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> 
girl of the people, poor enough to deem a
trampled flower a treasure-trove.</p>

<p>She carried me very gently, carefully veiling
me from sun and dust as we went; and when I
recovered perception I was floating in a porcelain
bath on the surface of cool, fresh water,
from which I drank eagerly as soon as my sickly
sense of faintness passed away.</p>

<p>My bath stood on the lattice-sill of a small
chamber; it was, I knew afterward, but a white
pan of common earthenware, such as you buy
for two sous and put in your birdcages. But
no bath of ivory and pearl and silver was ever
more refreshing to imperial or patrician limbs
than was that little clean and snowy pattypan
to me.</p>

<p>Under its reviving influences I became able
to lift my head and raise my leaves and spread
myself to the sunlight, and look round me.
The chamber was in the roof, high above the
traffic of the passage-way beneath; it was very
poor, very simple, furnished with few and homely
things. True, to all our nation of flowers it
matters little, when we are borne into captivity,
whether the prison-house which receives us be
palace or garret. Not to us can it signify whether
we perish in Sèvres vase of royal blue, or in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
kitchen pipkin of brown ware. Your lordliest
halls can seem but dark, pent, noisome dungeons
to creatures born to live on the wide plain, by
the sunlit meadow, in the hedgerow, or the forest,
or the green, leafy garden-way; tossing always
in the joyous winds, and looking always upward
to the open sky.</p>

<p>But it is of little use to dwell on this. You
think that flowers, like animals, were only created
to be used and abused by you, and that we,
like your horse and dog, should be grateful
when you honor us by slaughter or starvation
at your hands. To be brief, this room was
very humble, a mere attic, with one smaller still
opening from it; but I scarcely thought of its
size or aspect. I looked at nothing but the
woman who had saved me. She was quite
young; not very beautiful, perhaps, except for
wonderful soft azure eyes, and a mouth smiling
and glad, with lovely curves to the lips, and hair
dark as a raven’s wing, which was braided and
bound close to her head. She was clad very
poorly, yet with an exquisite neatness and even
grace; for she was of the people no doubt, but of
the people of France. Her voice was very melodious;
she had a silver cross on her bosom;
and, though her face was pale, it had health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>She was my friend, I felt sure. Yes, even
when she held me and pierced me with steel and
murmured over me, “They say roses are so
hard to rear so, and you are such a little thing;
but do grow to a tree and live with me. Surely,
you can if you try.”</p>

<p>She had wounded me sharply and thrust me
into a tomb of baked red clay filled with black
and heavy mould. But I knew that I was
pierced to the heart that I might—though only
a little offshoot gathered to die in a day—strike
root of my own and be strong, and carry a
crown of fresh blossoms. For she but dealt
with me as your world deals with you, when
your heart aches and your brain burns, and
Fate stabs you, and says in your ear, “O fool!
to be great you must suffer.” You to your fate
are thankless, being human; but I, a rose, was
not.</p>

<p>I tried to feel not utterly wretched in that
little, dull clay cell; I tried to forget my sweet,
glad southern birthplace, and not to sicken and
swoon in the noxious gases of the city air. I
did my best not to shudder in the vapor of the
stove, and not to grow pale in the clammy heats
of the street, and not to die of useless lamentation
for all that I had lost—for the noble tawny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
sunsets, and the sapphire blue skies, and the
winds all fragrant with the almond-tree flowers,
and the sunlight in which the yellow orioles
flashed like gold.</p>

<p>I did my best to be content and show my
gratitude all through a parching autumn and
a hateful winter; and with the spring a wandering
wind came and wooed me with low, amorous
whispers—came from the south, he said; and
I learned that even in exile in an attic window
love may find us out and make for us a country
and a home.</p>

<p>So I lived and grew and was happy there
against the small, dim garret panes, and my
lover from the south came, still faithful, year by
year; and all the voices round me said that I was
fair—pale indeed, and fragile of strength, as a
creature torn from its own land and all its friends
must be, but contented and glad, and grateful
to the God who made me, because I had not
lived in vain, but often saw sad eyes, half
blinded with toil and tears, smile at me when
they had no other cause for smiles.</p>

<p>“It is bitter to be mewed in a city,” said
once to me an old, old vine who had been
thrust into the stones below and had climbed
the house wall, Heaven knew how, and had lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
for half a century jammed between buildings,
catching a gleam of sunshine on his dusty
leaves once perhaps in a whole summer. “It
is bitter for us. I would rather have had the
axe at my root and been burned. But perhaps
without us the poorest of people would never
remember the look of the fields. When they
see a green leaf they laugh a little, and then
weep—some of them. We, the trees and the
flowers, live in the cities as those souls amongst
them whom they call poets live in the world,—exiled
from heaven that by them the world may
now and then bethink itself of God.”</p>

<p>And I believe that the vine spoke truly.
Surely, he who plants a green tree in a city way
plants a thought of God in many a human heart
arid with the dust of travail and clogged with
the greeds of gold. So, with my lover the
wind and my neighbor the vine, I was content
and patient, and gave many hours of pleasure
to many hard lives, and brought forth many a
blossom of sweetness in that little nook under
the roof.</p>

<p>Had my brothers and sisters done better, I
wonder, living in gilded balconies or dying in
jewelled hands?</p>

<p>I cannot say: I can only tell of myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<figure class="figright illowe15_625" id="i_p13">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p13.jpg" alt="In a very Narrow Street">
</figure>

<p>The attic in which
I found it my fate to
dwell was very high
in the air, set in one
of the peaked roofs
of the quarter of the
Luxembourg, in a
very narrow street,
populous, and full of
noise, in which people
of all classes, except
the rich, were to be
found—in a medley
of artists, students,
fruit-sellers, workers
in bronze and ivory,
seamstresses, obscure
actresses, and all the
creators, male and
female, of the thousand
and one airy arts
of elegant nothingness
which a world
of pleasure demands
as imperatively as a
world of labor demands
its bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>It would have been a street horrible and hideous
in any city save Rome or Paris: in Rome
it would have been saved by color and antiquity;
in Paris it was saved by color and
grace. Just a flash of a bright drapery, just
a gleam of a gay hue, just some tender pink
head of a hydrangea, just some quaint curl of
some gilded woodwork, just the green glimmer
of my friend the vine, just the snowy sparkle
of his neighbor the waterspout,—just these, so
little and yet so much, made the crooked passage
a bearable home, and gave it a kinship
with the glimpse of the blue sky above its pent
roofs.</p>

<p>O wise and true wisdom! to redeem poverty
with the charms of outline and of color, with the
green bough and the song of running water,
and the artistic harmony which is as possible to
the rough-hewn pine-wood as in the polished
ebony. “It is of no <i>use</i>!” you cry. O fools!
Which gives you perfume—we, the roses,
whose rich hues and matchless grace no human
artist can imitate, or the rose-trémière, which
mocks us, standing stiff and gaudy and scentless
and erect? Grace and pure color and cleanliness
are the divinities that redeem the foulness
and the ignorance and the slavery of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
crushed, coarse lives when you have sight
enough to see that they are divine.</p>

<p>In my little attic, in whose window I have
passed my life, they were known gods and honored;
so that, despite the stovepipe, and the
poverty, and the little ill-smelling candle, and
the close staircase without, with the rancid oil in
its lamps and its fetid faint odors, and the refuse,
and the gutters, and the gas in the street
below, it was possible for me, though a rose of
Provence and a rose of the open air freeborn,
to draw my breath in it and to bear my blossoms,
and to smile when my lover the wind
roused me from sleep with each spring, and
said in my ear, “Arise! for a new year is
come.” Now, to greet a new year with a smile,
and not a sigh, one must be tranquil, at least,
if not happy.</p>

<p>Well, I and the lattice, and a few homely
plants of saxafrage and musk and balsam who
bloomed there with me, and a canary who hung
in a cage amongst us, and a rustic creeper who
clung to a few strands of strained string and
climbed to the roof and there talked all day to
the pigeons—we all belonged to the girl with
the candid, sweet eyes, and by name she was
called Lili Kerrouel, and for her bread she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
gilded and colored those little cheap boxes for
sweetmeats that they sell in the wooden booths
at the fairs on the boulevards, while the <i>mirlitons</i>
whirl in their giddy go-rounds and the
merry horns of the charlatans challenge the
populace. She was a girl of the people: she
could read, but I doubt if she could write. She
had been born of peasant parents in a Breton
hamlet, and they had come to Paris to seek
work, and had found it for a while and prospered,
and then had fallen sick and lost it,
and struggled for a while, and then died, running
the common course of so many lives
amongst you. They had left Lili alone at sixteen,
or rather worse than alone—with an old
grandam, deaf and quite blind, who could do
nothing for her own support, but sat all day in
a wicker chair by the lattice or the stove, according
as the season was hot or cold, and
mumbled a little inarticulately over her worn
wooden beads.</p>

<p>Her employers allowed Lili to bring these
boxes to decorate at home, and she painted at
them almost from dawn to night. She swept,
she washed, she stewed, she fried, she dusted;
she did all the housework of her two little
rooms; she tended the old woman in all ways;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
and she did all these things with such cleanliness
and deftness that the attics were wholesome as
a palace; and though her pay was very small,
she yet found means and time to have her linen
spotless and make her pots and pans shine like
silver and gold, and to give a grace to all the
place, with the song of a happy bird and the
fragrance of flowers that blossomed their best
and their sweetest for her sake, when they would
fain have withered to the root and died in their
vain longing for the pure breath of the fields and
the cool of a green woodland world.</p>

<p>It was a little, simple, hard life, no doubt,—a
life one would have said scarce worth all the
trouble it took to get bread enough to keep it
going,—a hard life, coloring always the same
eternal little prints all day long, no matter how
sweet the summer day might be, or how hot
the tired eyes.</p>

<p>A hard life, with all the wondrous, glorious,
wasteful, splendid life of the beautiful city
around it in so terrible a contrast; with the roll
of the carriages day and night on the stones
beneath, and the pattering of the innumerable
feet below, all hurrying to some pleasure, and
every moment some burst of music or some
chime of bells or some ripple of laughter on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the air. A hard life, sitting one’s self in a little
dusky garret in the roof, and straining one’s
sight for two sous an hour, and listening to an
old woman’s childish mutterings and reproaches,
and having always to shake the head in refusal
of the neighbors’ invitations to a day in the
woods or a sail on the river. A hard life, no
doubt, when one is young and a woman, and
has soft, shining eyes and a red, curling mouth.</p>

<p>And yet Lili was content.</p>

<p>Content, because she was a French girl; because
she had always been poor, and thought
two sous an hour riches; because she loved
the helpless old creature whose senses had all
died while her body lived on; because she was
an artist at heart, and saw beautiful things
round her even when she scoured her brasses
and washed down her bare floor.</p>

<p>Content, because with it all she managed to
gather a certain “sweetness and light” into her
youth of toil; and when she could give herself
a few hours’ holiday, and could go beyond the
barriers, and roam a little in the wooded places,
and come home with a knot of primroses or a
plume of lilac in her hands, she was glad and
grateful as though she had been given gold and
gems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Ah! In the lives of you who have wealth
and leisure we, the flowers, are but one thing
among many: we have a thousand rivals in
your porcelains, your jewels, your luxuries,
your intaglios, your mosaics, all your treasures
of art, all your baubles of fancy. But in the
lives of the poor we are alone: we are all the
art, all the treasure, all the grace, all the beauty
of outline, all the purity of hue, that they possess:
often we are all their innocence and all
their religion too.</p>

<p>Why do you not set yourselves to make us
more abundant in those joyless homes, in those
sunless windows?</p>

<p>Now this street of hers was very narrow: it
was full of old houses, that nodded their heads
close together as they talked, like your old
crones over their fireside gossip.</p>

<p>I could, from my place in the window, see
right into the opposite garret window. It had
nothing of my nation in it, save a poor colorless
stone-wort, who got a dismal living in the gutter
of the roof, yet who too, in his humble way,
did good and had his friends, and paid the sun
and the dew for calling him into being. For
on that rainpipe the little dusty, thirsty sparrows
would rest and bathe and plume themselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
and bury their beaks in the pale stone-crop,
and twitter with one another joyfully, and
make believe that they were in some green and
amber meadow in the country in the cowslip
time.</p>

<p>I did not care much for the stone-crop or the
sparrows; but in the third summer of my captivity
there with Lili the garret casement opposite
stood always open, as ours did, and I could
watch its tenant night and day as I chose.</p>

<p>He had an interest for me.</p>

<p>He was handsome, and about thirty years
old; with a sad and noble face, and dark eyes
full of dreams, and cheeks terribly hollow, and
clothes terribly threadbare.</p>

<p>He thought no eyes were on him when my
lattice looked dark, for his garret, like ours,
was so high that no glance from the street ever
went to it. Indeed, when does a crowd ever
pause to look at a garret, unless by chance a
man have hanged himself out of its window?
That in thousands of garrets men may be dying
by inches for lack of bread, lack of hope, lack
of justice, is not enough to draw any eyes upward
to them from the pavement.</p>

<p>He thought himself unseen, and I watched
him many a long hour of the summer night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
when I sighed at my square open pane in the
hot, sulphurous mists of the street, and tried to
see the stars and could not. For, between me
and the one small breadth of sky which alone
the innumerable roofs left visible, a vintner had
hung out a huge gilded imperial crown as
a sign on his roof-tree; and the crown, with its
sham gold turning black in the shadow, hung
between me and the planets.</p>

<p>I knew that there must be many human souls
in a like plight with myself, with the light of
heaven blocked from them by a gilded tyranny;
and yet I sighed and sighed and sighed, thinking
of the white, pure stars of Provence throbbing
in her violet skies.</p>

<p>A rose is hardly wiser than a poet, you see;
neither rose nor poet will be comforted, and be
content to dwell in darkness because a crown
of tinsel swings on high.</p>

<p>Well, not seeing the stars as I strove to do,
I took refuge in sorrow for my neighbor. It
is well for your poet when he turns to a like
resource. Too often I hear he takes, instead,
to the wine-cellar which yawns under the crown
that he curses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_p22">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p22.jpg" alt="He was a Painter">
</figure>

<p>My neighbor, I soon saw, was poorer even
than we were. He was a painter, and he painted
beautiful things. But his canvases and the necessaries
of his art were nearly all that his empty
attic had in it; and when, after working many
hours with a wretched glimmer of oil, he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
come to his lattice and lean out, and try, as I
had tried, to see the stars, and fail, as I had
failed, I saw that he was haggard, pallid, and
weary unto death with two dire diseases,—hunger
and ambition.</p>

<p>He could not see the stars because of the
crown, but in time, in those long midsummer
nights, he came to see a little glow-worm amongst
my blossoms, which in a manner, perhaps, did
nearly as well.</p>

<p>He came to notice Lili at her work. Often
she had to sit up half the night to get enough
coloring done to make up the due amount of
labor; and she sat at her little deal table, with
her little feeble lamp, with her beautiful hair
coiled up in a great knot and her pretty head
drooping so wearily—as we do in the long
days of drought—but never once looking off,
nor giving way to rebellion or fatigue, though
from the whole city without there came one
ceaseless sound, like the sound of an endless
sea; which truly it was—the sea of pleasure.</p>

<p>Not for want of coaxings, not for want of
tempters, various and subtle, and dangers often
and perilously sweet, did Lili sit there in her
solitude earning two sous an hour with straining
sight and aching nerves that the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
paralytic creature within might have bed and
board without alms. Lili had been sore beset
in a thousand ways, for she was very fair to
see; but she was proud and she was innocent,
and she kept her courage and her honor; yea,
though you smile—though she dwelt under
an attic roof, and that roof a roof of Paris.</p>

<p>My neighbor, in the old gabled window over
the way, leaning above his stone-wort, saw her
one night thus at work by her lamp, with the
silver ear-rings, that were her sole heirloom and
her sole wealth, drooped against the soft hues
and curves of her graceful throat.</p>

<p>And when he had looked once, he looked
every night, and found her there; and I, who
could see straight into his chamber, saw that he
went and made a picture of it all—of me, and
the bird in the cage, and the little old dusky
lamp, and Lili with her silver ear-rings and her
pretty, drooping head.</p>

<p>Every day he worked at the picture, and
every night he put his light out and came and
sat in the dark square of his lattice, and gazed
across the street through my leaves and my
blossoms at my mistress. Lili knew nothing of
this watch which he kept on her; she had put
up a little blind of white network, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
fancied that it kept out every eye when it was
up; and often she took even that away, because
she had not the heart to deprive me of the few
faint breezes which the sultry weather gave us.</p>

<p>She never saw him in his dark hole in the
old gable there, and I never betrayed him—not
I. Roses have been the flowers of silence
ever since the world began. Are we not the
flowers of love?</p>

<p>“Who is he?” I asked of my gossip the vine.
The vine had lived fifty years in the street, and
knew the stories and sorrows of all the human
bees in the hive.</p>

<p>“He is called René Claude,” said the vine.
“He is a man of genius. He is very poor.”</p>

<p>“You use synonyms,” murmured the old
balsam, who heard.</p>

<p>“He is an artist,” the vine continued. “He
is young. He comes from the south. His
people are guides in the Pyrenees. He is a
dreamer of dreams. He has taught himself
many things. He has eloquence too. There
is a little club at the back of the house which
I climb over. I throw a tendril or two in
at the crevices and listen. The shutters are
closed. It is forbidden by law for men to
meet so. There René speaks by the hour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
superbly. Such a rush of words, such a glance,
such a voice, like the roll of musketry in anger,
like the sigh of music in sadness! Though
I am old, it makes the little sap there is left in
me thrill and grow warm. He paints beautiful
things too; so the two swallows say who build
under his eaves; but I suppose it is not of
much use: no one believes in him, and he almost
starves. He is young yet, and feels the
strength in him, and still strives to do great
things for the world that does not care a jot
whether he lives or dies. He will go on so a
little longer. Then he will end like me. I used
to try and bring forth the best grapes I could,
though they had shut me away from any sun to
ripen them and any dews to cleanse the dust
from them. But no one cared. No one gave
me a drop of water to still my thirst, nor pushed
away a brick to give me a ray more of light.
So I ceased to try and produce for their good;
and I only took just so much trouble as would
keep life in me myself. It will be the same
with this man.”</p>

<p>I, being young and a rose, the flower loved
of the poets, thought the vine was a cynic, as
many of you human creatures grow to be in the
years of your age when the leaves of your life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
fall sere. I watched René long and often. He
was handsome, he suffered much; and when
the night was far spent he would come to his
hole in the gable and gaze with tender, dreaming
eyes past my pale foliage to the face of
Lili. I grew to care for him, and I disbelieved
the prophecy of the vine; and I promised myself
that one summer or another, near or far,
the swallows, when they came from the tawny
African world to build in the eaves of the city,
would find their old friend flown and living no
more in a garret, but in some art-palace where
men knew his fame.</p>

<p>So I dreamed—I, a little white rose, exiled
in the passage of a city, seeing the pale moonlight
reflected on the gray walls and the dark
windows, and trying to cheat myself by a thousand
fancies into the faith that I once more
blossomed in the old, sweet, leafy garden-ways
in Provence.</p>

<p>One night—the hottest night of the year—Lili
came to my side by the open lattice. It
was very late; her work was done for the night.
She stood a moment, with her lips rested softly
on me, looking down on the pavement that
glistened like silver in the sleeping rays of the
moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_p28">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p28.jpg" alt="One Night ... Lili Came to my Side by the Open Lattice">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>For the first time she saw the painter René
watching her from his niche in the gable, with
eyes that glowed and yet were dim.</p>

<p>I think women foresee with certain prescience
when they will be loved. She drew the lattice
quickly to, and blew the lamp out: she kissed
me in the darkness. Because her heart was
glad or sorry? Both, perhaps.</p>

<p>Love makes one selfish. For the first time
she left my lattice closed all through the oppressive
hours until daybreak.</p>

<p>“Whenever a woman sees anything out of
her window that makes her eager to look again,
she always shuts the shutter. Why, I wonder?”
said the balsam to me.</p>

<p>“That she may peep unsuspected through
a chink,” said the vine round the corner, who
could overhear.</p>

<p>It was profane of the vine, and in regard to
Lili untrue. She did not know very well, I
dare say, why she withdrew herself on that sudden
impulse, as the pimpernel shuts itself up
at the touch of a raindrop.</p>

<p>But she did not stay to look through a crevice;
she went straight to her little narrow bed,
and told her beads and prayed, and slept till the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
cock crew in a stable near and the summer daybreak
came.</p>

<p>She might have been in a chamber all mirror
and velvet and azure and gold in any one of the
ten thousand places of pleasure, and been leaning
over gilded balconies under the lime leaves,
tossing up little paper balloons in the air for
gay wagers of love and wine and jewels. Pleasure
had asked her more than once to come
down from her attic and go with its crowds;
for she was fair of feature and lithe of limb,
though only a work-girl of Paris. And she
would not, but slept here under the eaves, as
the swallows did.</p>

<p>“We have not seen enough, little rose, you
and I,” she would say to me with a smile and a
sigh. “But it is better to be a little pale, and
live a little in the dark, and be a little cramped
in a garret window, than to live grand in the
sun for a moment, and the next to be tossed
away in a gutter. And one can be so happy
anyhow—almost anyhow!—when one is
young. If I could only see a very little piece
more of the sky, and get every Sunday out to
the dear woods, and live one floor lower, so
that the winters were not quite so cold and the
summers not quite so hot, and find a little more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
time to go to mass in the cathedral, and be able
to buy a pretty blue-and-white home of porcelain
for you, I should ask nothing more of the
blessed Mary—nothing more upon earth.”</p>

<p>She had had the same simple bead-roll of innocent
wishes ever since the first hour that she
had raised me from the dust of the street; and
it would, I doubt not, have remained her only
one all the years of her life, till she should have
glided down into a serene and cheerful old age
of poverty and labor under that very same roof,
without the blessed Mary ever deigning to
harken or answer. Would have done so if the
painter René could have seen the stars, and
so had not been driven to look instead at the
glow-worm through my leaves.</p>

<p>But after that night on which she shut to the
lattice so suddenly, I think the bead-roll lengthened—lengthened,
though for some time the
addition to it was written on her heart in a
mystical language which she did not try to
translate even to herself—I suppose fearing its
meaning.</p>

<p>René made approaches to his neighbor’s
friendship soon after that night. He was but
an art student, the son of a poor mountaineer,
and with scarce a thing he could call his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
except an easel of deal, a few plaster casts, and
a bed of straw. She was but a working-girl,
born of Breton peasants, and owning as her sole
treasures two silver ear-rings and a white rose.</p>

<p>But for all that, no courtship could have been
more reverential on the one side or fuller of
modest grace on the other if the scene of it had
been a palace of princes or a château of the
nobles.</p>

<p>He spoke very little.</p>

<p>The vine had said that at the club round the
corner he was very eloquent, with all the impassioned
and fierce eloquence common to men
of the south. But with Lili he was almost
mute. The vine, who knew human nature well—as
vines always do, since their juices unlock
the secret thoughts of men and bring to daylight
their darkest passions—the vine said that
such silence in one by nature eloquent showed
the force of his love and its delicacy.</p>

<p>This may be so: I hardly know. My lover
the wind, when he is amorous, is loud; but then
it is true his loves are not often very constant.</p>

<p>René chiefly wooed her by gentle service.
He brought her little lovely wild flowers, for
which he ransacked the woods of St. Germains
and Meudon. He carried the billets of her firewood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
up the seven long, twisting, dirty flights
of stairs. He fought for her with the wicked
old porteress at the door downstairs. He
played to her in the gray of the evening on a
quaint, simple flute, a relic of his boyhood, the
sad, wild, touching airs of his own southern
mountains—played at his open window while
the lamps burned through the dusk, till the
people listened at their doors and casements
and gathered in groups in the passage below,
and said to one another, “How clever he is!—and
he starves.”</p>

<p>He did starve very often, or at least he had
to teach himself to keep down hunger with a
morsel of black chaff-bread and a stray roll of
tobacco. And yet I could see that he had become
happy.</p>

<p>Lili never asked him within her door. All
the words they exchanged were from their open
lattices, with the space of the roadway between
them.</p>

<p>I heard every syllable they spoke, and they
were on the one side most innocent and on the
other most reverential. Ay, though you may
not believe it—you who know the people of
Paris from the travesties of theatres and the
slanders of salons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>And all this time secretly he worked on at
her portrait. He worked out of my sight and
hers, in the inner part of his garret, but the
swallows saw and told me. There are never
any secrets between birds and flowers.</p>

<p>We used to live in Paradise together, and we
love one another as exiles do; and we hold in
our cups the raindrops to slake the thirst of the
birds, and the birds in return bring to us from
many lands and over many waters tidings of
those lost ones who have been torn from us to
strike the roots of our race in far-off soils and
under distant suns.</p>

<p>Late in the summer of the year, one wonderful
fête-day, Lili did for once get out to
the woods, the old kindly green woods of Vincennes.</p>

<p>A neighbor on a lower floor, a woman who
made poor, scentless, senseless, miserable imitations
of all my race in paper, sat with the old
bedridden grandmother while Lili took her
holiday—so rare in her life, though she was
one of the motes in the bright champagne of the
dancing air of Paris. I missed her sorely on
each of those few sparse days of her absence,
but for her I rejoiced.</p>

<p>“<i>Je reste: tu ’t’en vas</i>,” says the rose to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
butterfly in the poem; and I said so in my
thoughts to her.</p>

<p>She went to the broad level grass, to the
golden fields of the sunshine, to the sound of
the bees murmuring over the wild purple
thyme, to the sight of the great snowy clouds
slowly sailing over the sweet blue freedom of
heaven—to all the things of my birthright
and my deathless remembrance—all that no
woman can love as a rose can love them.</p>

<p>But I was not jealous; nay, not though she
had cramped me in a little earth-bound cell of
clay. I envied wistfully indeed, as I envied the
swallows their wings which cleft the air, asking
no man’s leave for their liberty. But I would
not have maimed a swallow’s pinion had I had
the power, and I would not have abridged an
hour of Lili’s freedom. Flowers are like your
poets: they give ungrudgingly, and, like all
lavish givers, are seldom recompensed in kind.</p>

<p>We cast all our world of blossom, all our
treasury of fragrance, at the feet of the one we
love; and then, having spent ourselves in that
too abundant sacrifice, you cry, “A yellow,
faded thing!—to the dust-hole with it!” and
root us up violently and fling us to rot with the
refuse and offal; not remembering the days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
when our burden of beauty made sunlight in
your darkest places, and brought the odors of a
lost paradise to breathe over your bed of fever.</p>

<p>Well, there is one consolation. Just so likewise
do you deal with your human wonder-flower
of genius.</p>

<p>Lili went for her day in the green midsummer
world—she and a little blithe, happy-hearted
group of young work-people—and I stayed in
the garret window, hot and thirsty, and drooping
and pale, choked by the dust that drifted
up from the pavement, and hearing little all
day long save the quarrels of the sparrows and
the whir of the engine wheels in a baking-house
close at hand.</p>

<p>For it was some great day or other, when all
Paris was out <i>en fête</i>, and every one was away
from his or her home, except such people as
the old bedridden woman and the cripple who
watched her. So, at least, the white roof-pigeons
told me, who flew where they listed,
and saw the whole splendid city beneath them—saw
all its glistening of arms and its sheen
of palace roofs, all its gilded domes and its
white, wide squares, all its crowds, many-hued
as a field of tulips, and its flashing eagles golden
as the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>When I had been alone two hours, and whilst
the old building was silent and empty, there
came across the street from his own dwelling-place
the artist René, with a parcel beneath his
arm.</p>

<p>He came up the stairs with a light, noiseless
step, and pushed open the door of our attic.
He paused on the threshold a moment, with the
sort of reverent, hushed look on his face that
I had seen on the faces of one or two swarthy,
bearded, scarred soldiers as they paused before
the picinas at the door of the little chapel which
stood in my sight on the other side of our
street.</p>

<p>Then he entered, placed that which he carried
on a wooden chair fronting the light, uncovered
it, and went quietly out again, without the
women in the inner closet hearing him.</p>

<p>What he had brought was the canvas I had
seen grow under his hand, the painting of me
and the lamp and Lili. I do not doubt how he
had done it; it was surely the little attic window,
homely and true in likeness, and yet he had
glorified us all, and so framed in my leaves and
my white flowers, the low oil flame and the fair
head of my mistress, that there was that in the
little picture which made me tremble and yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
be glad. On a slender slip of paper attached
to it there was written, “<i>Il n’y a pas de nuit
sans étoile.</i>”</p>

<p>Of him I saw no more. The picture kept
me silent company all the day.</p>

<p>At evening Lili came. It was late. She
brought with her a sweet, cool perfume of dewy
mosses and fresh leaves and strawberry plants—sweet
as honey. She came in with a dark,
dreamy brilliance in her eyes and long coils of
foliage in her hands.</p>

<p>She brought to the canary chickweed and a
leaf of lettuce. She kissed me and laid wet
mosses on my parching roots, and fanned me
with the breath of her fresh lips. She took to
the old women within a huge cabbage leaf full
of cherries, having, I doubt not, gone herself
without in order to bring the ruddy fruit to
them.</p>

<p>She had been happy, but she was very quiet.
To those who love the country as she and I
did, and, thus loving it, have to dwell in cities,
there is as much of pain, perhaps, as of pleasure
in a fleeting glimpse of the lost heaven.</p>

<p>She was tired, and sat for a while, and did
not see the painting, for it was dusk. She only
saw it when she rose and turned to light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the lamp; then, with a little shrill cry, she
fell on her knees before it in her wonder and
her awe, and laughed and sobbed a little, and
then was still again, looking at this likeness of
herself.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p39.jpg" alt="She Fell on her Knees before it">
</figure>

<p>The written words took her long to spell out,
for she could scarcely read, but when she had
mastered them, her head sank on her breast
with a flush and a smile, like the glow of the
dawn over Provence, I thought.</p>

<p>She knew whence it came, no doubt, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
there were many artists and students of art in
that street.</p>

<p>But then there was only one who had watched
her night after night as men watched the stars
of old to read their fates in the heavens.</p>

<p>Lili was only a young <i>ouvrière</i>, she was only
a girl of the people: she had quick emotions
and innocent impulses; she had led her life
straightly because it was her nature, as it is
of the lilies—her namesakes, my cousins—to
grow straight to the light, pure and spotless.
But she was of the populace; she was frank,
fearless, and strong, despite all her dreams. She
was glad, and she sought not to hide it. With
a gracious impulse of gratitude she turned to
the lattice and leaned past me, and looked for
my neighbor.</p>

<p>He was there in the gloom; he strove not
to be seen, but a stray ray from a lamp at the
vintner’s gleamed on his handsome dark face,
lean and pallid and yearning and sad, but full
of force and of soul like a head of Rembrandt’s.
Lili stretched her hands to him with a noble,
candid gesture and a sweet, tremulous laugh:
“What you have given me!—it is you?—it
<i>is</i> you?”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle forgives?” he murmured,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
leaning as far out as the gable would permit.
The street was still deserted, and very
quiet. The theatres were all open to the
people that night free, and bursts of music
from many quarters rolled in through the sultry
darkness.</p>

<p>Lili colored over all her fair, pale face, even
as I have seen my sisters’ white breasts glow to
a wondrous, wavering warmth as the sun of the
west kissed them. She drew her breath with a
quick sigh. She did not answer him in words,
but with a sudden movement of exquisite eloquence
she broke from me my fairest and my
last-born blossom and threw it from her lattice
into his.</p>

<p>Then, as he caught it, she closed the lattice
with a swift, trembling hand, and left the chamber
dark, and fled to the little sleeping-closet
where her crucifix and her mother’s rosary hung
together above her bed.</p>

<p>As for me, I was left bereaved and bleeding.
The dew which waters the growth of your
human love is usually the tears or blood of
some martyred life.</p>

<p>I loved Lili.</p>

<p>I prayed, as my torn stem quivered and my
fairest begotten sank to her death in the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
and the silence, that I might be the first and
the last to suffer from the human love born that
night.</p>

<p>I, a rose—Love’s flower.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span>, before that summer was gone, these
two were betrothed to one another, and my
little fair dead daughter, all faded and scentless
though her half-opened leaves were, remained
always on René’s heart as a tender and treasured
relic.</p>

<p>They were betrothed, I say—not wedded,
for they were so terribly poor.</p>

<p>Many a day he, I think, had not so much as
a crust to eat; and there passed many weeks
when the works on his canvas stood unfinished
because he had not wherewithal to buy the oils
and the colors to finish them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>René was frightfully poor, indeed; but then,
being an artist and a poet, and the lover of
a fair and noble woman, and a dreamer of
dreams, and a man God-gifted, he was no
longer wretched. For the life of a painter is
beautiful when he is still young, and loves truly,
and has a genius in him stronger than all calamity,
and hears a voice in which he believes
say always in his ear: “Fear nothing. Men
must believe as I do in thee, one day. And
meanwhile we can wait!” And a painter in
Paris, even though he starve on a few sous a
day, can have so much that is lovely and full
of picturesque charm in his daily pursuits: the
long, wondrous galleries full of the arts he
adores; the “<i>réalité de l’idéal</i>” around him in
that perfect world; the slow, sweet, studious
hours in the calm wherein all that is great
in humanity alone survives; the trance—half
adoration, half aspiration, at once desire and
despair—before the face of the Mona Lisa;
then, without, the streets so glad and so gay in
the sweet, living sunshine; the quiver of green
leaves among gilded balconies; the groups at
every turn about the doors; the glow of color in
market-place and peopled square; the quaint
gray piles in old historic ways; the stones, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
every one of which some voice from the imperishable
Past cries out; the green, silent woods,
the little leafy villages, the winding waters
garden-girt; the forest heights, with the city
gleaming and golden in the plain;—all these
are his. With these—and youth—who shall
dare say he is not rich—ay, though his board
be empty and his cup be dry?</p>

<p>I had not loved Paris—I, a little imprisoned
rose, caged in a clay pot, and seeing nothing
but the sky-line of the roofs. But I grew to
love it, hearing from René and from Lili of all
the poetry and gladness that Paris made possible
in their young and burdened lives, and
which could have been thus possible in no
other city of the earth.</p>

<p>City of Pleasure you have called her, and
with truth; but why not also City of the
Poor? for that city, like herself, has remembered
the poor in her pleasure, and given to
them, no less than to the richest, the treasure of
her laughing sunlight, of her melodious music,
of her gracious hues, of her million flowers, of
her shady leaves, of her divine ideals.</p>

<p>O world! when you let Paris die you will let
your last youth die with her! Your rich will
mourn a paradise deserted, but your poor will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
have need to weep with tears of blood for the
ruin of the sole Eden whose sunlight sought
them in their shadow, whose music found them
in their loneliness, whose glad green ways were
open to their tired feet, whose radiance smiled
the sorrow from their aching eyes, and in whose
wildest errors and whose vainest dreams their
woes and needs were unforgotten.</p>

<p>Well, this little, humble love-idyl, which
grew into being in an attic, had a tender grace
of its own; and I watched it with tenderness,
and it seemed to me fresh as the dews of the
morning in the midst of the hot, stifling world.</p>

<p>They could not marry: he had nothing but
famine for his wedding-gift, and all the little
that she made was taken for the food and wine
of the bedridden old grandam in that religious
execution of a filial duty which is so habitual
in the French family-life that no one dreams
counting it as a virtue.</p>

<p>But they spent their leisure time together:
they passed their rare holiday hours in each
other’s society in the woods which they both
loved or in the public galleries of art; and
when the autumn came on apace, and they
could no longer sit at their open casements, he
still watched the gleam of her pale lamp as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
pilgrim the light of a shrine, and she, ere she
went to her rest, would push ajar the closed
shutter and put her pretty fair head into the
darkling night, and waft him a gentle good-night,
and then go and kneel down by her bed
and pray for him and his future before the
cross which had been her dead mother’s.</p>

<p>On that bright summer a hard winter followed.
The poor suffered very much; and I
in the closed lattice knew scarcely which was
the worse—the icy, shivering chills of the
snow-burdened air, or the close, noxious suffocation
of the stove.</p>

<p>I was very sickly and ill, and cared little for
my life during that bitter cold weather, when
the panes of the lattice were all blocked from
week’s end to week’s end with the solid, silvery
foliage of the frost.</p>

<p>René and Lili both suffered greatly: he
could only keep warmth in his veins by the
stoves of the public libraries, and she lost her
work in the box trade after the New Year fairs,
and had to eke out as best she might the few
francs she had been able to lay back in the
old brown pipkin in the closet. She had, moreover,
to sell most of the little things in her garret;
her own mattress went, though she kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the bed under her grandmother. But there
were two things she would not sell, though for
both was she offered money; they were her
mother’s reliques and myself.</p>

<p>She would not, I am sure, have sold the picture,
either. But for that no one offered her a
centime.</p>

<p>One day, as the last of the winter solstice was
passing away, the old woman died.</p>

<p>Lili wept for her sincere and tender tears,
though never in my time, nor in any other, I
believe, had the poor old querulous, paralytic
sufferer rewarded her with anything except
lamentation and peevish discontent.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i> you will come to me?” murmured her
lover, when they had returned from laying the
old dead peasant in the quarter of the poor.</p>

<p>Lili drooped her head softly upon his breast.</p>

<p>“If you wish it!” she whispered, with a whisper
as soft as the first low breath of summer.</p>

<p><i>If</i> he wished it!</p>

<p>A gleam of pale gold sunshine shone through
the dulled panes upon my feeble branches;
a little timid fly crept out and spread its wings;
the bells of the church rang an angelus; a child
laughed in the street below; there came a smile
of greenness spreading over the boughs of leafless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
trees; my lover, the wind, returned from
the south, fresh from desert and ocean, with the
scent of the spice groves and palm aisles of the
East in his breath, and, softly unclosing my lattice,
murmured to me: “Didst thou think I was
faithless? See, I come with the spring!”</p>

<p>So, though I was captive and they two were
poor, yet we three were all happy; for love
and a new year of promise were with us.</p>

<p>I bore a little snowy blossom (sister to the
one which slept lifeless on René’s heart) that
spring, whilst yet the swallows were not back
from the African gardens, and the first violets
were carried in millions through the streets—the
only innocent imperialists that the world
has ever seen.</p>

<p>That little winter-begotten darling of mine was
to be Lili’s nuptial-flower. She took it so tenderly
from me that it hardly seemed like its death.</p>

<p>“My little dear rose, who blossoms for me,
though I can only cage her in clay, and only
let her see the sun’s rays between the stacks of
the chimneys!” she said softly over me as she
kissed me; and when she said that, could I any
more grieve for Provence?</p>

<p>“What do they wed upon, those two?” said
the old vine to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>And I answered him, “Hope and dreams.”</p>

<p>“Will those bake bread and feed babes?”
said the vine, as he shook his wrinkled tendrils
despondently in the March air.</p>

<p>We did not ask in the attic.</p>

<p>Summer was nigh at hand, and we loved one
another.</p>

<p>René had come to us—we had not gone to
him. For our garret was on the sunny, his on
the dark, side of the street, and Lili feared the
gloom for me and the bird; and she could not
bring herself to leave that old red-leaved
creeper who had wound himself so close about
the rainpipe and the roof, and who could not
have been dislodged without being slain.</p>

<p>With the Mardi Gras her trade had returned
to her. René, unable to prosecute his grand
works, took many of the little boxes in his own
hands, and wrought on them with all the nameless
mystical charm and the exquisite grace of
touch which belong to the man who is by
nature a great artist. The little trade could
not at its best price bring much, but it brought
bread; and we were happy.</p>

<p>While he worked at the box lids she had
leisure for her household labors; when these
were done she would draw out her mother’s old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Breton distaff, and would sit and spin. When
twilight fell they would go forth together to
dream under the dewy avenues and the glistening
stars, or as often would wait within whilst
he played on his mountain flute to the people
at the doorways in the street below.</p>

<p>“Is it better to go out and see the stars and
the leaves ourselves, or to stay indoors and make
all these forget the misfortune of not seeing
them?” said Lili on one of those evenings when
the warmth and the sunset almost allured her to
draw the flute from her husband’s hands and give
him his hat instead; and then she looked down
into the narrow road, at the opposite houses, at
the sewing-girls stitching by their little windows,
at the pale students studying their sickly
lore with scalpel and with skeleton, at the hot,
dusty little children at play on the asphalt
sidewalk, at the sorrowful, darkened casements
behind which she knew beds of sickness or of
paralyzed old age were hidden—looked at all
this from behind my blossoms, and then gave
up the open air and the evening stroll that
were so dear a pastime to her, and whispered
to René, “Play, or they will be disappointed.”</p>

<p>And he played, instead of going to the debating-club
in the room round the corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“He has ceased to be a patriot,” grumbled
the old vine. “It is always so with every man
when once he has loved a woman!”</p>

<p>Myself, I could not see that there was less
patriotism in breathing the poetry of sound
into the ears of his neighbors than in rousing
the passions of hell in the breasts of his
brethren.</p>

<p>But perhaps this was my ignorance: I believe
that of late years people have grown to
hold that the only pure patriotism is, and ought
to be, evinced in the most intense and the most
brutalized form of one passion,—“Envy, eldest-born
of hell.”</p>

<p>So these two did some good, and were happy,
though more than once it chanced to them to
have to go a whole day without tasting food of
any sort.</p>

<p>I have said that René had genius,—a genius
bold, true, impassioned, masterful,—such a
genius as colors the smallest trifles that it
touches. René could no more help putting an
ideal grace into those little sweetmeat boxes—which
sold at their very highest, in the booths
of the fairs, at fifty centimes apiece—than we,
the roses, can help being fragrant and fair.</p>

<p>Genius has a way of casting its pearls in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
dust as we scatter our fragrance to every breeze
that blows. Now and then the pearl is caught
and treasured, as now and then some solitary
creature pauses to smell the sweetness of the
air in which we grow, and thanks the God who
made us.</p>

<p>But as ninety-nine roses bloom unthanked
for one that is thus remembered, so ninety-nine
of the pearls of genius are trodden to pieces
for one that is set on high and crowned with
honor.</p>

<p>In the twilight of a dull day a little, feeble,
brown old man climbed the staircase and entered
our attic with shambling step.</p>

<p>We had no strangers to visit us: who visits
the poor? We thought he was an enemy: the
poor always do think so, being so little used to
strangers.</p>

<p>René drew himself erect, and strove to hide
the poverty of his garments, standing by his
easel. Lili came to me and played with my
leaves in her tender, caressing fashion.</p>

<p>“You painted this, M. René Claude?” asked
the little brown old man. He held in his hand
one of the bonbon boxes, the prettiest of them
all, with a tambourine-girl dancing in a wreath
of Provence roses. René had copied me with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
loving fidelity in the flowers, and with a sigh
had murmured as he cast the box aside when
finished: “That ought to fetch at least a
franc!” But he got no more than the usual
two sous for it.</p>

<p>The little man sat down on the chair which
Lili placed for him.</p>

<p>“So they told me where I bought this. It
was at a booth at St. Cloud. Do you know
that it is charming?”</p>

<p>René smiled a little sadly; Lili flushed with
joy. It was the first praise which she had ever
heard given to him.</p>

<p>“You have a great talent,” pursued the little
man.</p>

<p>René bowed his handsome, haggard face—his
mouth quivered a very little: for the first
time Hope entered into him.</p>

<p>“Genius, indeed,” said the stranger; and he
sauntered a little about and looked at the canvases,
and wondered and praised, and said not
very much, but said that little so well and so
judiciously that it was easy to see he was no
mean judge of art, and possibly no slender
patron of it.</p>

<p>As Lili stood by me I saw her color come
and go and her breast heave. I too trembled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
in all my leaves: were recognition and the
world’s homage coming to René at last?</p>

<p>“And I have been so afraid always that I
had injured, burdened him, clogged his strength
in that endless strife!” she murmured below
her breath. “O dear little rose! if only the
world can but know his greatness!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the old man looked through the
sketches and studies with which the room was
strewed. “You do not finish your things?” he
said abruptly.</p>

<p>René flushed darkly. “Oil pictures cost
money,” he said briefly, “and—I am very
poor.”</p>

<p>Though a peasant’s son, he was very proud:
the utterance must have cost him much.</p>

<p>The stranger took snuff. “You are a man
of singular genius,” he said simply. “You
only want to be known to get the prices of
Meissonier.”</p>

<p>Meissonier!—the Rothschild of the studios,
the artist whose six-inch canvas would bring
the gold value of a Raphael or a Titian!</p>

<p>Lili, breathing fast, and white as death with
ecstasy, made the sign of the cross on her
breast; the delicate brown hand of René shook
where it leaned on his easel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>They were both silent—silent from the intensity
of their hope.</p>

<p>“Do you know who I am?” the old man
pursued with a cordial smile.</p>

<p>“I have not that honor,” murmured René.</p>

<p>The stranger, taking his snuff out of a gold
box, named a name at which the painter started.
It was that of one of the greatest art dealers in
the whole of Europe,—one who at a word
could make or mar an artist’s reputation,—one
whose accuracy of judgment was considered
infallible by all connoisseurs, and the passport
to whose galleries was to any unknown painting
a certain passport also to the fame of men.</p>

<p>“You are a man of singular genius,” repeated
the great purchaser, taking his snuff in the middle
of the little bare chamber. “It is curious—one
always finds genius either in a cellar or
in an attic: it never, by any chance, is to be
discovered midway on the stairs—never in the
<i>mezzo terzo</i>! But to the point. You have
great delicacy of touch, striking originality, a
wonderful purity yet bloom in your color, and
an exquisite finish of minutiæ, without any weakness,—a
combination rare, very rare. That
girl yonder, feeding white pigeons on the leads
of a roof, with an atom of blue sky, and a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
vine leaves straying over the parapet—that is
perfectly conceived. Finished it must be. So
must that little study of the beggar-boy looking
through the gilded gates into the rose-gardens—it
is charming, charming. Your price for
those?”</p>

<p>René’s colorless, worn young face colored to
the brows. “Monsieur is too good,” he muttered
brokenly. “A nameless artist has no
price, except—”</p>

<p>“Honor,” murmured Lili as she moved forward
with throbbing heart and dim eyes. “Ah,
monsieur, give him a name in Paris! We want
nothing else—nothing else!”</p>

<p>“Poor fools!” said the dealer to his snuff-box.
I heard him—they did not.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he answered aloud, “Paris herself
will give him that the first day his first canvas
hangs in my galleries. Meanwhile, I must
in honesty be permitted to add something more.
For each of those little canvases, the girl on the
roof and the boy at the gate, I will give you now
two thousand francs, and two thousand more
when they shall be completed. Provided—”</p>

<p>He paused and glanced musingly at René.</p>

<p>Lili had turned away, and was sobbing for
very joy at this undreamed-of deliverance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>René stood quite still, with his hands crossed
on the easel and his head bent on his chest.
The room, I think, swam around him.</p>

<p>The old man sauntered again a little about
the place, looking here and looking there,
murmuring certain artistic disquisitions technical
and scientific, leaving them time to recover
from the intensity of their emotion.</p>

<p>What a noble thing old age was, I thought,
living only to give hope to the young in their
sorrow, and to release captive talents from the
prison of obscurity! We should leave the little
room in the roof, and dwell in some bright quarter
where it was all leaves and flowers; and
René would be great, and go to dine with
princes and drive a team of belled horses, like a
famous painter who had dashed once with his
splendid equipage through our narrow passage;
and we should see the sky always—as much of
it as ever we chose; and Lili would have a garden
of her own, all grass and foliage and falling
waters, in which I should live in the open air all
the day long, and make believe that I was in
Provence.</p>

<p>My dreams and my fancies were broken by the
sound of the old man’s voice taking up the thread
of his discourse once more in front of René.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“I will give you four thousand francs each
for those two little canvases,” he repeated. “It
is a mere pinch of dust to what you will make
in six months’ time if—if—you hear me?—your
name is brought before the public of Paris
in my galleries and under my auspices. I suppose
you have heard something of what I can
do, eh? Well, all I can do I will do for you;
for you have a great talent, and without introduction,
my friend, you may as well roll up
your pictures and burn them in your stove to
save charcoal. You know that?”</p>

<p>René indeed knew—none better. Lili turned
on the old man her sweet, frank Breton eyes,
smiling their radiant gratitude through tenderest
tears.</p>

<p>“The saints will reward you, monsieur,
in a better world than this,” she murmured
softly.</p>

<p>The old man took snuff a little nervously.
“There is one condition I must make,” he said
with a trifling hesitation—“one only.”</p>

<p>“Ask of my gratitude what you will,” answered
René quickly, while he drew a deep
breath of relief and freedom,—the breath of
one who casts to the ground the weight of a
deadly burden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“It is, that you will bind yourself only to
paint for me.”</p>

<p>“Certainly!” René gave the assent with
eagerness. Poor fellow! it was a novelty so
exquisite to have any one save the rats to paint
for. It had never dawned upon his thoughts
that when he stretched his hands out with such
passionate desire to touch the hem of the garment
of Fortune and catch the gleam of the
laurels of Fame, he might be in truth only holding
them out to fresh fetters.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the old man quietly, and
he sat down again and looked full in René’s
face, and unfolded his views for the artist’s future.</p>

<p>He used many words, and was slow and suave
in their utterance, and paused often and long
to take out his heavy gold box; but he spoke
well. Little by little his meaning gleamed out
from the folds of verbiage in which he skilfully
enwrapped it.</p>

<p>It was this.</p>

<p>The little valueless drawings on the people’s
sweetmeat boxes of gilded cardboard had a
grace, a color, and a beauty in them which had
caught, at a fair-booth in the village of St.
Cloud, the ever-watchful eyes of the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
dealer. He had bought half a dozen of the
boxes for a couple of francs. He had said,
“Here is what I want.” Wanted for what?
Briefly, to produce Petitot enamels and Fragonard
cabinets—genuine eighteenth-century
work. There was a rage for it. René would
understand?</p>

<p>René’s dark southern eyes lost a little of their
new lustre of happiness, and grew troubled with
a sort of cloud of perplexity. He did not seem
to understand.</p>

<p>The old man took more snuff, and used
phrases clearer still.</p>

<p>There were great collectors—dilettanti of
houses imperial and royal and princely and
noble, of all the grades of greatness—who
would give any sum for <i>bonbonnières</i> and <i>tabatières</i>
of eighteenth-century work by any one of
the few famous masters of that time. A genuine,
incontestable sweetmeat box from the <i>ateliers</i>
of the Louis XIV. or Louis XV. period
would fetch almost a fabulous sum. Then again
he paused, doubtfully.</p>

<p>René bowed, and his wondering glance said
without words, “I know this. But I have no
eighteenth-century work to sell you: if I had,
should we starve in an attic?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>His patron coughed a little, looked at Lili,
then proceeded to explain yet further.</p>

<p>In René’s talent he had discerned the hues,
the grace, the delicacy yet brilliancy, the voluptuousness
and the <i>désinvolteure</i> of the best
eighteenth-century work. René doubtless did
other and higher things which pleased himself
far more than these airy trifles. Well, let him
pursue the greater line of art if he chose; but
he, the old man who spoke, could assure him
that nothing would be so lucrative to him as
those bacchantes in wreaths of roses and young
tambourine-players <i>gorge au vent</i> dancing in a
bed of violets, and beautiful marquises, powdered
and jewelled, looking over their fans, which he
had painted for those poor little two-sous boxes
of the populace, and the like of which, exquisitely
finished on enamel or ivory, set in gold
and tortoise-shell rimmed with pearls and turquoises
or opals and diamonds, would deceive
the finest connoisseur in Europe into receiving
them as—whatever they might be signed and
dated.</p>

<p>If René would do one or two of these at dictation
in a year, not more,—more would be
perilous,—paint and sign them and produce
them with any touches that might be commanded;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
never ask what became of them when
finished, nor recognize them if hereafter he
might see them in any illustrious collection—if
René would bind himself to do this, he, the
old man who spoke, would buy his other paintings,
place them well in his famous galleries,
and, using all his influence, would make him in
a twelvemonth’s time the most celebrated of
all the young painters of Paris.</p>

<p>It was a bargain? Ah, how well it was, he
said, to put the best of one’s powers into the
most trifling things one did! If that poor little
two-sous box had been less lavishly and gracefully
decorated, it would never have arrested
his eyes in the bonbon-booth at St. Cloud.
The old man paused to take snuff and receive
an answer.</p>

<p>René stood motionless.</p>

<p>Lili had sunk into a seat, and was gazing at
the tempter with wide-open, puzzled, startled
eyes. Both were silent.</p>

<p>“It is a bargain?” said the old man again.
“Understand me, M. René Claude. You have
no risk, absolutely none, and you have the certainty
of fair fame and fine fortune in the space
of a few years. You will be a great man before
you have a gray hair: that comes to very few.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
I shall not trouble you for more than two <i>dix-huitième
siècle</i> enamels in the year—perhaps
for only one. You can spend ten months out
of the twelve on your own canvases, making
your own name and your own wealth as swiftly
as your ambition and impatience can desire.
Madame here,” said the acute dealer with a
pleasant smile—“Madame here can have a
garden sloping on the Seine and a glass house
of choicest flowers—which I see are her graceful
weakness—ere another rose-season has time
to come round, if you choose.”</p>

<p>His voice lingered softly on the three last
words.</p>

<p>The dew stood on René’s forehead, his hands
clenched on the easel.</p>

<p>“You wish me—to—paint—forgeries of the
Petitot enamels?”</p>

<p>The old man smiled unmoved: “Chut, chut!
Will you paint me little <i>bonbonnières</i> on enamel
instead of on cardboard? That is all
the question. I have said where they go, how
they are set: what they are called shall be my
affair. You know nothing. The only works of
yours which you will be concerned to acknowledge
will be your own canvas pictures. What
harm can it do any creature? You will gratify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
a connoisseur or two innocently, and you will
meanwhile be at leisure to follow the bent of
your own genius, which otherwise—”</p>

<p>He paused: I heard the loud throbs of
René’s heart under that cruel temptation.</p>

<p>Lili gazed at his tempter with the same startled
terror and bewilderment still dilating her
candid eyes with a woful pain.</p>

<p>“Otherwise,” pursued the old man with merciless
tranquillity, “you will never see me any
more, my friends. If you try to repeat any
story to my hindrance, no one will credit you.
I am rich, you are poor. You have a great
talent: I shall regret to see it lost, but I shall
let it die—so.”</p>

<p>And he trod very gently on a little gnat that
crawled near his foot, and killed it.</p>

<p>A terrible agony gathered in the artist’s face.</p>

<p>“O God!” he cried in his torture, and his
eyes went to the canvases against the wall, and
then to the face of his wife, with an unutterable,
yearning desire.</p>

<p>For them, for <i>them</i>, this sin which tempted
him looked virtue.</p>

<p>“Do you hesitate?” said the merciless old
man. “Pshaw! whom do you hurt? You
give me work as good as that which you imitate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
and I call it only by a dead man’s name: who
is injured? What harm can there be in humoring
the fanaticism of fashion? Choose—I am
in haste.”</p>

<p>René hid his face with his hands, so that he
should not behold those dear creations of his
genius which so cruelly, so innocently, assailed
him with a temptation beyond his strength.</p>

<p>“Choose for me—you!” he muttered in his
agony to Lili.</p>

<p>Lili, white as death, drew closer to him.</p>

<p>“My René, your heart has chosen,” she murmured
through her dry, quivering lips. “You
cannot buy honor by fraud.”</p>

<p>René lifted his head and looked straight in
the eyes of the man who held the scales of his
fate, and could weigh out for his whole life’s
portion either fame and fortune, or obscurity
and famine.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he said slowly, with a bitter, tranquil
smile about his mouth, “my garret is empty,
but it is clean. May I trouble you to leave it
as you found it?”</p>

<p>So they were strong to the end, these two
famished children of frivolous Paris.</p>

<p>But when the door had closed and shut their
tempter out, the revulsion came: they wept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
those tears of blood which come from the hearts’
depths of those who have seen Hope mock them
with a smile a moment, to leave them face to
face with Death.</p>

<p>“Poor fools!” sighed the old vine from his
corner in the gray, dull twilight of the late
autumn day.</p>

<p>Was the vine right?</p>

<p>The air which he had breathed for fifty years
through all his dust-choked leaves and tendrils
had been the air off millions of human lungs,
corrupted in its passage through millions of
human lips; and the thoughts which he thought
were those of human wisdom:</p>

<p>The sad day died; the night fell; the lattice
was closed; the flute lay untouched. A great
misery seemed to enfold us. True, we were no
worse off than we had been when the same day
dawned. But that is the especial cruelty of
every tempter always: he touches the innocent,
closed eyes of his victims with a collyrium
which makes the happy blindness of content
no longer possible. If strong to resist him, he
has still his vengeance, for they are never again
at peace as they were before that fatal hour in
which he showed them all that they were not,
all that they might be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>Our stove was not more chill, our garret
not more empty; our darkness not more dark
amidst the gay, glad, dazzling city; our dusky
roof and looming crown that shut the sky out
from us not more gloomy and impenetrable
than they had been on all those other earlier
nights when yet we had been happy. Yet how
intensified million-fold seemed cold and loneliness
and poverty and darkness, all!—for we
had for the first time known what it was to think
of riches, of fame, of homage, of light, as <i>possible</i>,
and then to lose them all forever!</p>

<p>I had been resigned for love’s sake to dwell
amongst the roofs, seeing not the faces of the
stars, nor feeling ever the full glory of the sun;
but now—I had dreamed of the fair freedom
of garden-ways and the endless light of summer
suns on palace terraces, and I drooped and
shivered and sickened, and was twice captive
and twice exiled, and knew that I was a little
nameless, worthless, hapless thing, whose fairest
chaplet of blossom no hand would ever gather
for a crown.</p>

<p>As with my life, so was it likewise with theirs.</p>

<p>They had been so poor, but they had been
so happy: the poverty remained, the joy had
flown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>The winter was again very hard, very cold:
they suffered greatly.</p>

<p>They could scarcely keep together body and
soul, as your strange phrase runs; they went
without food sometimes for days and days, and
fuel they had scarcely ever.</p>

<p>The bird in his cage was sold; they would
not keep the little golden singing thing to starve
to silence like themselves.</p>

<p>As for me, I nearly perished of the cold;
only the love I bore to Lili kept a little life in
my leafless branches.</p>

<p>All that cruel winter-time they were strong
still, those children of Paris.</p>

<p>For they sought no alms, and in their uttermost
extremity neither of them ever whispered
to the other: “Go seek the tempter; repent,
be wise. Give not up our lives for a mere
phantasy of honor.”</p>

<p>“When the snow is on the ground, and the
canvases have to burn in the stove, then you
will change your minds and come to me on
your knees,” the old wicked, foul spirit had said
mocking them, as he had opened the door of
the attic and passed away creaking down the
dark stairs.</p>

<p>And I suppose he had reckoned on this; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
if he had done so, he had reckoned without his
host, as your phrase runs: neither René nor Lili
ever went to him, either on knees or in any
other wise.</p>

<p>When the spring came we three were still all
living—at least their hearts still beat and their
lips still drew breath, as my boughs were still
green and my roots still clung to the soil. But
no more to them or to me did the coming of
spring bring, as of old, the real living of life,
which is joy. And my lover the wind wooed
me no more, and the birds no more brought me
the rose-whispers of my kindred in Provence.
For even the little pigeon-hole in the roof had
become too costly a home for us, and we dwelt
in a den under the stones of the streets, where
no light came and scarce a breath of air ever
strayed to us.</p>

<p>There the uncompleted canvases, on which
the painter whom Lili loved had tried to write
his title to the immortality of fame, were at last
finished—finished, for the rats ate them.</p>

<p>All this while we lived—the man whose
genius and misery were hell on earth; the
woman whose very purity and perfectness of
love were her direst torture; and I, the little
white flower born of the sun and the dew, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
fragrance and freedom, to whom every moment
of this blindness, this suffocation, this starvation,
this stench of putrid odors, this horrible roar of
the street above, was a moment worse than any
pang of death.</p>

<p>Away there in Provence so many a fair rose-sister
of mine bowed her glad, proud, innocent
head with anguish and shuddering terrors to the
sharp summons of the severing knife that cut
in twain her life, whilst I—I, on and on—was
forced to keep so much of life as lies in the
capacity to suffer and to love in vain.</p>

<p>So much was left to them: no more.</p>

<p>“Let us compel Death to remember us, since
even Death forgets us!” René murmured once
in his despair to her.</p>

<p>But Lili had pressed her famished lips to his:
“Nay, dear, wait; God will remember us even
yet, I think.”</p>

<p>It was her faith. And of her faith she was
justified at last.</p>

<p>There came a ghastlier season yet, a time of
horror insupportable—of ceaseless sound beside
which the roar of the mere traffic of the
streets would have seemed silence—a stench
beside which the sulphur smoke and the gas
fumes of a previous time would have been as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
some sweet, fresh woodland air—a famine beside
which the daily hunger of the poor was remembered
as the abundance of a feast—a cold
beside which the chillness of the scant fuel and
empty braziers of other winters were recalled
as the warmth of summer—a darkness only
lit by the red flame of burning houses—a
solitude only broken by the companionship of
woe and sickness and despair—a suffocation
only changed by a rush of air strong with the
scent of blood, of putridity, of the million living
plague-stricken, of the million dead lying
unburied.</p>

<p>For there was war.</p>

<p>Of year or day or hour I knew nothing. It
was always the same blackness as of night; the
same horror of sound, of scent, of cold; the
same misery; the same torture. I suppose
that the sun was quenched, that the birds were
dumb, that the winds were stilled forever—that
all the world was dead; I do not know. They
called it War. I suppose that they meant—Hell!</p>

<p>Yet Lili lived, and I; in that dead darkness
we had lost René—we saw his face no more.
Yet he could not be in his grave, I knew, for
Lili, clasping my barren branches to her breast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
would murmur: “Whilst he still lives I will live—yes,
yes, yes!”</p>

<p>And she did live—so long, so long!—on a
few draughts of water and a few husks of grain.</p>

<p>I knew that it was long, for full a hundred
times she muttered aloud: “Another day? O
God!—how long? how long?”</p>

<p>At last in the darkness a human hand was
stretched to her, once, close beside me. A foul,
fierce light, the light of flame, was somewhere
on the air about us, and that moment glowed
through the horrid gloom we dwelt in in the
bowels of the earth. I saw the hand and what
it held to her; it was a stranger’s, and it held
the little colorless dead rose, my sweetest blossom,
that had lain ever upon René’s heart.</p>

<p>She took it—she who had given it as her
first love-gift. She was mute. In the glare of
the flame that quivered through the darkness I
saw her—standing quite erect and very still.</p>

<p>The voice of a stranger thrilled through the
din from the world above.</p>

<p>“He fought as only patriots can,” it said
softly and as through tears. “I was beside
him. He fell with Regnault in the sortie yesterday.
He could not speak; he had only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
strength to give me this for you. Be comforted;
he has died for Paris.”</p>

<p>On Lili’s face there came once more the
radiance of a perfect peace, a glory pure and
endless as the glory of the sun. “Great in
death!” she murmured. “My love, my love,
I come!”</p>

<p>I lost her in the darkness.</p>

<p>I heard a voice above me say that life had
left her lips as the dead rose touched them.</p>

<p>What more is there for me to tell?</p>

<p>I live, since to breathe, and to feel pain, and
to desire vainly, and to suffer always, are surest
proofs of life.</p>

<p>I live, since that stranger’s hand, which
brought my little dead blossom as the message
of farewell, had pity on me and brought
me away from that living grave. But the pity
was vain; I died the only death that had any
power to hurt me when the human heart I loved
grew still forever.</p>

<p>The light of the full day now shines on me;
the shadows are cool, the dews are welcome;
they speak around me of the coming of spring,
and in the silence of the dawns I hear from the
woods without the piping of the nesting birds;
but for me the summer can never more return—for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
me the sun can never again be shining—for
me the greenest garden world is barren as a
desert.</p>

<p>For I am only a little rose, but I am in exile
and France is desolate.</p>
